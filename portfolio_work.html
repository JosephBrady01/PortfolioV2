            <h2> Small Brief: Cleversteam search result redesign</h2>
            <p> During my University course I had to complete a Portfolio module,
                this module consisted of 3 tasks: create a portfolio website and complete a large & small task. I had a
                limited number of
                tasks to chose from, some from acutal companies & some were fake scenarios created to be as close to
                industry standard as possible.</p>
            <p>For my small brief I chose Cleversteam's search results redesign. The project involved a search system for different 
                volunteers for different sorts of schemes, what they wanted was a way to see more information about the candidate without 
                having to go to another page.</p>

            <p>My interpretaion of the brief was that Clevesteam wanted a new way to view more information whilst keeping to the basic 
              retangular tile layout. The premise was to be able to let employers view an applicant on the search page, rather than, 
              have 5 tabs open for different applicants. The overall goal is to give an employer the information needed to interview the 
              applicant, saving time loading multiple pages for each applicant.</p>
              <p>The first step in the project was to create a wireframe from the brief, I decided to make two different designs, 
                one utilizing text and another utilizing icons to bring down the amount of text on the tile. As you can see from the 
                above images 2 & 3.
              </p>
              <p>The next step in the cycle was to turn the wireframes into prototypes using the Figma programme. Represented by images 
                4 & 5 I believe that the first design although the icons were a good idea taking up less text on the til overall the text 
                orientation/order wasn't thought through and came out not knowing where one section ended or not.
                The second design , represented by images 6 & 7 was the design I chose for the final build, I thought that the use of 
                colour to distinguish the short card from the expanded area was very good and that the text was aligned much better than the previous 
                design.
            </p>
            <p> The final step was to code the tile design that I chose, I believe that because I followed the cycle well the final result is very 
              similar to the protottype design. If you would like to see how the project turned out then click the repository link below.</p>

          <h2>Large Brief: Doggie Walks Website</h2>
          <p>A fake client had comissioned a website for their dog walking company. 
            They had filled out preferences and specifications to follow and outlined features from other sites they liked.</p>
            <p>My interpretaion of the brief was that the client wanted a professional yet friendly looking website for potential new 
              clients or existing clients looking for more information about the company. This meant, to me, that the focus would be 
              advertising their services to potential new customers.</p>

                  <p>The brief began like the previous, getting ideas down onto paper and creating wireframes. 
                    I decided that the homepage and the team page were very impotant and therefore created these for my fireframes,
                    represented by images 1 & 2. The wireframes were very challenging to turn into prototypes becuase of the sheer 
                    scale of the site but with some skill and determination I believe I created some very nice looking prototypes,
                    represented by images 3 onwards.</p>
                    <p>This poject was coded using the vue.js framework to gain experince using frameworks and use a frontend heavy framework
                       I decided that vue.js was the framekwork I wanted to learn more about but I am in the proccess of remaking the site as
                       there were some features that did not end updated being implemented into the final build like the map location on the 
                       homepage. I hope to implement more features while making the site again. The reporsitory link can be found below.</p>
